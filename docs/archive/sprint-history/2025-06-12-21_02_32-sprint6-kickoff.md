## Sprint 6 Priorities

### ðŸ”´ TOP PRIORITY: Production Security Hardening

#### 1. Compliance Framework Implementation
**Target**: SOC2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR compliance
**Files to create**:
- `pkg/security/compliance.go` - Core compliance framework
- `pkg/security/audit.go` - Audit trail system
- `pkg/security/dataprotection.go` - Data classification and protection

#### 2. Threat Detection & Response
**Target**: Real-time threat detection with automated response
**Files to create**:
- `pkg/security/threat.go` - Threat detection engine
- `pkg/security/incident.go` - Incident response automation
- `pkg/security/forensics.go` - Forensics data collection

### ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY: Infrastructure Automation

#### 3. Infrastructure as Code
**Target**: Complete deployment automation
**Files to create**:
- `pkg/deployment/infrastructure.go` - IaC template generation
- `pkg/deployment/pipeline.go` - Deployment pipeline automation
- `pkg/deployment/rollback.go` - Automated rollback strategies

#### 4. Multi-Region & Disaster Recovery
**Target**: High availability and business continuity
**Files to create**:
- `pkg/disaster/recovery.go` - DR management system
- `pkg/disaster/failover.go` - Automated failover
- `pkg/disaster/sync.go` - Multi-region data synchronization

### ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY: Advanced Monitoring

#### 5. SLA Monitoring & Alerting
**Target**: Production-grade monitoring and alerting
**Files to create**:
- `pkg/monitoring/alerting.go` - Intelligent alerting system
- `pkg/monitoring/sla.go` - SLA monitoring and reporting
- `pkg/monitoring/cost.go` - Cost optimization automation

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1 (Days 1-5)
**Monday-Tuesday**: Security hardening (compliance, audit, data protection)
**Wednesday-Thursday**: Threat detection and incident response
**Friday**: Infrastructure automation foundation

### Week 2 (Days 6-10)
**Monday-Tuesday**: Disaster recovery and multi-region support
**Wednesday-Thursday**: Advanced monitoring and alerting
**Friday**: Integration testing and documentation

## Performance Targets

### Maintain Excellence
- **Total Security Overhead**: <2ms (current observability ~25Âµs)
- **Compliance Overhead**: <500Âµs per request
- **Threat Detection**: <100Âµs per request
- **Monitoring Overhead**: <1ms for all new features

### Operational Performance
- **Deployment Time**: <5 minutes
- **Failover Time**: <30 seconds
- **Recovery Time**: <15 minutes
- **Alert Response**: <1 minute

## Success Criteria

### Security
- [ ] Complete compliance framework with audit trails
- [ ] Real-time threat detection with <100Âµs overhead
- [ ] Automated incident response playbooks
- [ ] Data classification and protection policies

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code template generation
- [ ] Automated deployment pipelines
- [ ] Multi-region failover automation
- [ ] Blue/green deployment support

### Monitoring
- [ ] SLA monitoring with intelligent alerting
- [ ] Cost optimization automation
- [ ] Performance trend analysis
- [ ] Capacity planning automation

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Security Performance Impact** - Mitigation: Micro-benchmarks for each feature
2. **Compliance Complexity** - Mitigation: Modular framework design
3. **Multi-Region Complexity** - Mitigation: Phased implementation

### Dependencies
- DynamORM team for audit storage patterns
- Security team review for compliance framework
- Operations team for DR procedures

## Next Steps
1. Implement compliance framework foundation
2. Create audit trail system
3. Build threat detection engine
4. Develop infrastructure automation
5. Implement disaster recovery patterns

Let's build enterprise-grade security and infrastructure! ðŸš€
