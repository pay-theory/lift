**Date**: 2025-06-12 18:09:41  
**Sprint**: 4  
**Focus**: Performance Benchmarking & Optimization  
**Status**: Starting Implementation

## Sprint 4 Objectives

### 🎯 Primary Goals
1. **Performance Benchmarking** - Establish comprehensive baselines
2. **Cold Start Optimization** - Target <15ms framework overhead
3. **Enhanced Error Handling** - Production-grade error management
4. **Resource Management** - Connection pooling and pre-warming
5. **Cross-Feature Integration** - Full stack testing

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ Sprint 3 Achievements
- Event source adapters completed (6 adapters, 100% test coverage)
- Core framework foundation solid
- Routing, middleware, and type-safe handlers working
- Examples directory well-structured

### 🔍 Sprint 4 Starting Point
- Benchmarks directory exists but empty
- Core lift package has all major components
- Need to establish performance baselines
- Integration testing framework needed

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Benchmark Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. **Cold Start Benchmarks**
   - Framework initialization overhead
   - Memory allocation patterns
   - Garbage collection impact

2. **Routing Performance**
   - Test with 100, 500, 1000 routes
   - Path parameter extraction
   - Method matching efficiency

3. **Middleware Chain Performance**
   - Overhead measurement per middleware
   - Chain composition efficiency
   - Memory usage patterns

4. **Event Adapter Performance**
   - Parsing overhead for each event type
   - Memory allocation during parsing
   - Batch processing efficiency

### Phase 2: Optimization Implementation (Week 2)
1. **Resource Pooling**
   - Connection pool implementation
   - Buffer pooling for requests/responses
   - Memory reuse strategies

2. **Error Handling Enhancement**
   - Structured error types
   - Recovery strategies
   - Performance impact measurement

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Full stack scenarios
   - Cross-team dependency validation
   - Production-like load testing

## Success Criteria
