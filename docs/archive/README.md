## üóÇÔ∏è Archive Policy

Documents are archived when:
1. **Sprints are completed** - Sprint-specific documentation moves to `sprint-history/`
2. **Decisions are superseded** - Old decision records move to `decisions-archive/`
3. **Notes become historical** - Working notes that are no longer active move to `notes-archive/`

## üîÑ Restoration

If archived documentation needs to be restored to active status:
1. Move the file back to the appropriate active directory
2. Update any references or links
3. Consider if the content needs updating for current context
