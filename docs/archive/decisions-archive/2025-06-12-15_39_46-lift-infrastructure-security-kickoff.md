# Lift Infrastructure & Security - Project Kickoff Notes
*Date: 2025-06-12 15:39:46*
*Author: Infrastructure & Security Engineer*

## Project Overview
The Lift framework is a Go-based serverless handler library for AWS Lambda that will replace Pay Theory's current Python/CloudFormation infrastructure with Go/Pulumi. My role focuses specifically on the infrastructure, security, observability, and database integration aspects.

## Current State Analysis
Based on the existing documentation, the project has comprehensive planning with:

1. **Development Plan** - 772 lines of detailed implementation strategy
2. **Security Architecture** - 577+ lines of security requirements and patterns  
3. **Technical Architecture** - 1008+ lines of infrastructure design specifications
4. **Implementation Roadmap** - 711+ lines of sprint-based deliverables

## My Primary Responsibilities (Infrastructure & Security Focus)

### Immediate Priority (Sprints 1-6): Security Foundation
- **Multi-tenant security** with enterprise features
- **JWT authentication** with role-based access control
- **Cross-account communication** for Pay Theory integration
- **AWS Secrets Manager** integration
- **Request signing and validation**
- **Rate limiting** (per-user, per-tenant, global)

### Core Implementation Areas

#### 1. Security Package Structure
```go
type SecurityConfig struct {
    JWTConfig        JWTConfig
    APIKeyConfig     APIKeyConfig
    RBACEnabled      bool
    DefaultRoles     []string
    TenantValidation bool
    CrossAccountAuth bool
    EncryptionAtRest bool
    KMSKeyID         string
    RequestSigning   bool
    MaxRequestSize   int64
}

type Principal struct {
    UserID    string
    TenantID  string  
    AccountID string // Partner or Kernel account
    Roles     []string
    Scopes    []string
}
```

#### 2. Authentication Middleware Stack
- JWT validation with tenant isolation
- API Key authentication  
- Rate limiting (multi-level)
- Request signature validation
- CORS with security headers
- Input sanitization

#### 3. Observability System (Sprints 11-12)
- Structured logging with CloudWatch Logs
- Custom metrics with CloudWatch Metrics
- Distributed tracing with X-Ray
- Cost tracking and optimization alerts
- Performance monitoring dashboards

#### 4. Database Integration (Sprints 9-10)
- DynamoDB with DynamORM integration
- PostgreSQL/MySQL with connection pooling
- Redis for caching and session management
- Connection health monitoring
- Automatic failover and retry logic

#### 5. Event Source Adapters (Sprints 7-8)
- API Gateway, SQS, S3, EventBridge adapters
- Automatic event type detection
- Batch processing for SQS messages
- Dead letter queue handling
- Event replay and retry mechanisms

#### 6. Infrastructure as Code (Sprints 17-18)
- Pulumi components for Lambda deployment
- Multi-account deployment patterns
- Observability stack deployment
- VPC and networking setup
- Cross-account role assumptions

## Security Requirements Highlights

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- **Tenant Isolation**: Complete data isolation by tenant
- **Cross-Tenant Prevention**: No data leakage between tenants
- **Audit Logging**: All access logged with tenant context

### Pay Theory Integration Patterns
- **Kernel Communication**: Secure cross-account API calls
- **Partner Isolation**: Partner data completely isolated
- **Compliance**: PCI DSS and SOC 2 compliance patterns

### Performance Requirements
- Authentication overhead <2ms
- Rate limiting overhead <1ms
- Observability overhead <3ms
- 99.9% availability target

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Sprint 1 - Weeks 1-2)
1. **Set up security package structure** in the Go module
2. **Implement AWS Secrets Manager integration**
3. **Create basic JWT authentication middleware**
4. **Establish security configuration patterns**
5. **Set up initial observability framework**

### Week 1 Focus
- Initialize security package with proper structure
- Create SecurityConfig and Principal types
- Set up AWS Secrets Manager client
- Begin JWT middleware implementation
- Establish logging patterns

### Week 2 Focus  
- Complete JWT authentication middleware
- Add basic rate limiting
- Implement request validation
- Create initial health check endpoints
- Set up security headers middleware

## Integration Points

### With Core Framework Team
- Middleware interface integration
- Security settings through App configuration  
- Security errors using framework error types

### With DynamORM Team
- First-class DynamORM integration
- Transaction management for writes
- Connection pooling patterns

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities in production
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation verified  
- [ ] Cross-account communication secured
- [ ] Compliance requirements met (PCI DSS, SOC 2)
- [ ] 80% unit test code coverage maintained
- [ ] Performance targets achieved

## Questions/Clarifications Needed
1. Specific AWS account structure for Partner/Kernel accounts
2. Existing DynamORM integration patterns to follow
3. Current JWT provider and signing key management
4. Specific compliance requirements timeline
5. Rate limiting thresholds and strategies
