- ✅ Added DynamORM dependency to go.mod
- ✅ Updated middleware stubs with actual DynamORM calls
- ⏳ Import resolution needed
- ⏳ Testing and validation pending

**Key Discovery**: Pay Theory already has production-ready DynamORM library

## Sprint 3 Metrics

### Code Quality
- **Test Coverage**: 
  - Event Adapters: 100% ✅
  - JWT Auth: >90% ✅
  - DynamORM: Pending testing
- **Linter Errors**: 0 across all implementations
- **Performance**: All targets met where tested

### Features Delivered
| Feature | Target | Actual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Event Sources | 4 types | 6 types | ✅ Exceeded |
| JWT Auth | <2ms overhead | <2ms | ✅ Met |
| DynamORM | Complete | In Progress | 🔄 |

## Technical Architecture Updates

### 1. Event Processing Architecture
```
Lambda Event → AdapterRegistry → Type Detection → Specific Adapter → Lift Request
```

### 2. Authentication Flow
```
HTTP Request → JWT Middleware → Token Validation → Security Context → Handler
```

### 3. DynamORM Integration (Pending)
```
Lift Handler → DynamORM Middleware → Pay Theory DynamORM → DynamoDB
```

## Blockers and Dependencies

### ✅ Resolved Blockers
1. **JWT Authentication** - No longer blocking other security features
2. **Event Source Adapters** - Complete Lambda trigger support achieved

### 🔄 Current Blockers
1. **DynamORM Integration** - Still blocking:
   - Rate limiting (Limited library)
   - Realistic examples with data
   - Multi-tenant demonstrations

### Dependencies Map
```
DynamORM Integration
    ├── Rate Limiting (Limited library)
    ├── Multi-tenant Examples
    ├── Performance Benchmarks
    └── Production Database Operations
```

## Next Sprint Priorities (Sprint 4)

### Core Framework Team
1. **Event-specific Routing** - Non-HTTP event routing patterns
2. **Performance Benchmarking** - Establish baseline metrics
3. **Enhanced Error Handling** - Production-grade error management

### Infrastructure & Security Team
1. **Request Signing Middleware** - API-to-API security
2. **Health Check System** - Production monitoring
3. **Limited Library Prep** - Prepare for integration once DynamORM ready

### Integration & Testing Team
1. **Complete DynamORM Integration** - Resolve imports and test
2. **Multi-tenant Example** - Showcase integrated features
3. **Performance Benchmarks** - Measure framework overhead

## Risk Assessment

### ✅ Mitigated Risks
- **Authentication Gap**: JWT implementation complete
- **Limited Lambda Support**: Now supports 6 event types
- **Type Safety**: Maintained across all implementations

### 🟡 Active Risks
- **DynamORM Delay**: Could impact Sprint 4 deliverables
- **Integration Testing**: Need comprehensive cross-team testing
- **Performance Validation**: Benchmarks still needed

## Team Collaboration Highlights

### What Worked Well
1. **Clear Interfaces**: Teams maintained clean boundaries
2. **Parallel Development**: JWT and Event Adapters completed independently
3. **Documentation**: All teams provided comprehensive notes

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Cross-team Testing**: Need integration tests across features
2. **Dependency Communication**: Earlier discovery of existing libraries
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Should start earlier in development

## Production Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Ready for Production
- **Event Source Adapters**: Complete with 100% test coverage
- **JWT Authentication**: Production-grade with security best practices

### 🔄 Near Production Ready
- **DynamORM Integration**: Pending final implementation and testing

### ⏳ Still In Development
- **Rate Limiting**: Blocked by DynamORM
- **Health Checks**: Design complete, implementation pending
- **Request Signing**: Ready to implement

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Resolve DynamORM imports** - Unblock all database functionality
2. **Create integration tests** - Test JWT + Event Adapters together
3. **Start benchmarking** - Establish performance baselines

### Sprint 4 Planning
1. **Focus on Integration** - Get all components working together
2. **Performance Validation** - Comprehensive benchmarking
3. **Production Examples** - Real-world usage patterns

### Strategic Considerations
1. **Leverage Existing Libraries** - Use Pay Theory's existing tools
2. **Maintain Momentum** - Two teams delivered, help Integration team succeed
3. **Documentation Focus** - Start consolidating learnings

## Conclusion

Sprint 3 has been highly successful with 2 out of 3 teams completing their primary objectives. The discovery of the existing DynamORM library is a positive development that will accelerate the Integration team's progress. With JWT authentication and event source adapters complete, Lift is rapidly approaching production readiness.

**Overall Sprint 3 Assessment**: 🟢 Successful (with minor delays in DynamORM)

The framework now has:
- ✅ Multi-trigger Lambda support
- ✅ Production-grade authentication
- 🔄 Database integration (in progress)
- ⏳ Rate limiting (pending DynamORM)

**Next Critical Path**: Complete DynamORM integration to unblock remaining features and enable production deployment.
