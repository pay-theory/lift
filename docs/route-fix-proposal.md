  Date: 2024-01-24
  Author: Cloud Security Analyst
  
  ## Bug Description
  
  When handling non-HTTP events (S3, EventBridge, Scheduled, SQS, etc.), the `method` and `path` fields in the router's Handle function are empty strings. This causes routing to fail because:
  
  1. The event adapters don't populate `Method` and `Path` fields (they're HTTP-specific)
  2. The HTTP router was trying to handle all events, including non-HTTP ones
  3. The EventRouter existed but wasn't being used by the App
  
  ## Root Cause
  
  The `App` struct was missing integration with the `EventRouter`. All events were being routed through the HTTP router, which expects method and path values.
  
  ### Event Flow Issue:
  ```
  EventBridge Event -> Adapter -> Request{Method:"", Path:""} -> HTTP Router -> FAIL
  ```
  
  ### Expected Flow:
  ```
  EventBridge Event -> Adapter -> Request{TriggerType:EventBridge} -> EventRouter -> SUCCESS
  ```
  
  ## Fix Applied
  
  ### 1. Added EventRouter to App struct
  ```go
  type App struct {
   router      *Router      // HTTP router
   eventRouter *EventRouter // Non-HTTP event router
   // ...
  }
  ```
  
  ### 2. Updated App initialization
  ```go
  app := &App{
   router:      NewRouter(),
   eventRouter: NewEventRouter(),
   // ...
  }
  ```
  
  ### 3. Modified Handle method to route events correctly
  ```go
  func (a *App) Handle(method, path string, handler interface{}) *App {
   triggerType := parseTriggerType(method)
   if triggerType != TriggerUnknown && triggerType != TriggerAPIGateway {
    // Non-HTTP event -> use EventRouter
    a.eventRouter.AddEventRoute(triggerType, path, eventHandler)
   } else {
    // HTTP event -> use regular Router
    a.router.AddRoute(method, path, h)
   }
  }
  ```
  
  ### 4. Updated HandleRequest to use appropriate router
  ```go
  if req.TriggerType != TriggerAPIGateway && req.TriggerType != TriggerAPIGatewayV2 {
   // Use EventRouter for non-HTTP events
   err = a.eventRouter.HandleEvent(liftCtx)
  } else {
   // Use HTTP Router for HTTP events
   err = a.router.Handle(liftCtx)
  }
  ```
  
  ## How Event Routing Works Now
  
  ### HTTP Events:
  - Method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
  - Path: /api/users, /health, etc.
  - Routed by: HTTP Router using method + path
  
  ### Non-HTTP Events:
  - TriggerType: Scheduled, EventBridge, S3, SQS, etc.
  - Pattern: Rule name, source pattern, bucket name, queue name
  - Routed by: EventRouter using trigger type + pattern matching
  
  ## Usage Examples
  
  ```go
  // HTTP routing (unchanged)
  app.GET("/api/users", handleUsers)
  app.POST("/api/users", createUser)
  
  // Event routing (now works correctly)
  app.Handle("Scheduled", "health-check-rule", handleHealthCheck)
  app.Handle("EventBridge", "myapp.users*", handleUserEvents)
  app.Handle("S3", "my-bucket", handleS3Upload)
  app.Handle("SQS", "my-queue", handleQueueMessage)
  ```
  
  ## Pattern Matching
  
  The EventRouter supports pattern matching for each event type:
  
  - **Scheduled**: Matches rule name from ARN
  - **EventBridge**: Matches source field (supports wildcards)
  - **S3**: Matches bucket name
  - **SQS**: Matches queue name or ARN
  
  ## Testing
  
  Created test examples in:
  - `examples/test-scheduled-fix/` - Simple scheduled event test
  - `examples/test-event-routing-bug/` - Comprehensive multi-event test
  
  ## Impact
  
  This fix enables proper routing for all non-HTTP Lambda event sources, making Lift truly multi-event capable as intended.
