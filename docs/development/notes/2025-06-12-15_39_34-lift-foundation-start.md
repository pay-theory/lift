# Lift Framework Foundation - Session Start
**Date**: 2025-06-12-15_39_34  
**Focus**: Sprint 1-2 Foundation Implementation

## Session Goals
Implementing the core foundation of the Lift framework as outlined in the Implementation Roadmap:

### Sprint 1 Deliverables (Weeks 1-2) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Initialize Go module with proper structure
- [x] Implement core types (App, Context, Handler)
- [x] Basic security foundation
- [x] Initial test framework

### Sprint 2 Deliverables (Weeks 3-4) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Request/Response structures
- [x] Basic routing system
- [x] Minimal working example
- [x] Performance benchmarks baseline

## Implementation Summary

### Core Components Built
1. **Handler System** (`pkg/lift/handler.go`)
   - Type-safe Handler interface
   - Generic TypedHandler with compile-time type checking
   - SimpleHandler convenience function for easy typed handlers
   - typedHandlerAdapter for seamless integration

2. **Request/Response System** (`pkg/lift/request.go`, `pkg/lift/response.go`)
   - Unified Request structure supporting multiple Lambda triggers
   - TriggerType enumeration (API Gateway, SQS, S3, EventBridge, Schedule)
   - Response with JSON/Text/HTML/Binary support
   - Multi-tenant support with UserID/TenantID fields

3. **Enhanced Context** (`pkg/lift/context.go`)
   - Rich context with Request/Response, Logger, Metrics
   - Parameter extraction (path, query, headers)
   - Validation support with pluggable Validator interface
   - Timeout utilities for async operations
   - Multi-tenant context utilities

4. **Routing Engine** (`pkg/lift/router.go`)
   - Path parameter support (e.g., `/users/:id`)
   - Exact and pattern matching
   - Middleware chain execution
   - Efficient route lookup

5. **Application Container** (`pkg/lift/app.go`)
   - Fluent API with method chaining
   - Configuration management
   - Dependency injection (Logger, Metrics, DB)
   - Lambda event handling

6. **Error Handling** (`pkg/errors/errors.go`)
   - Structured LiftError with HTTP status codes
   - Error constructors (BadRequest, Unauthorized, etc.)
   - Request ID tracking for observability
   - Error chaining and details

7. **Middleware System** (`pkg/middleware/middleware.go`)
   - Essential middleware: Logger, Recover, CORS, Timeout
   - Metrics collection middleware
   - Request ID generation
   - Error handling middleware

### Testing Foundation
- Comprehensive unit tests with 100% passing rate
- Router path matching validation
- Application lifecycle testing
- Type safety verification

### Working Example
Created `examples/hello-world/main.go` demonstrating:
- Type-safe handlers with automatic JSON parsing
- Path parameter extraction
- Query parameter handling
- Error handling
- Multi-tenant context utilities

## Key Architecture Decisions
Based on the prompt and documentation:

1. **Type Safety First**: Using Go generics for compile-time type checking
2. **Security by Design**: AWS Secrets Manager integration, request signing
3. **Performance Target**: <15ms cold start overhead, <5MB memory
4. **DynamORM Integration**: First-class support for Pay Theory's DynamORM
5. **Multi-tenant Support**: UserID/TenantID context utilities
