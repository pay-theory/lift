## Sprint 6 Architecture Plan

### Phase 1: Advanced Testing Framework (Days 1-3)
```go
// pkg/testing/enterprise/
├── patterns.go          // Enterprise testing patterns
├── environments.go      // Multi-environment testing
├── contracts.go         // Contract testing framework
├── chaos.go            // Chaos engineering testing
├── performance.go      // Performance validation
└── regression.go       // Regression detection
```

### Phase 2: Enterprise Examples (Days 4-6)
```go
// examples/enterprise-*/
├── banking/            // Financial services example
├── healthcare/         // Compliance example
├── ecommerce/          // E-commerce platform
├── multi-region/       // Multi-region deployment
└── microservices/      // Microservices architecture
```

### Phase 3: Performance & Deployment (Days 7-10)
```go
// pkg/testing/deployment/
├── validator.go        // Deployment validation
├── bluegreen.go       // Blue/green testing
├── canary.go          // Canary deployment
├── infrastructure.go   // Infrastructure testing
└── security.go        // Security validation
```

## Day 1 Action Plan: Advanced Testing Patterns

### 1. Multi-Environment Testing Framework
**Objective**: Support testing across multiple environments with different configurations

```go
type EnterpriseTestSuite struct {
    app           *TestApp
    environments  map[string]*TestEnvironment
    dataFixtures  *DataFixtureManager
    mockServices  *ServiceMockRegistry
    performance   *PerformanceValidator
}
```

### 2. Contract Testing Framework
**Objective**: Validate service contracts and API compatibility

```go
type ContractTest struct {
    provider string
    consumer string
    contract *Contract
    validator ContractValidator
}
```

### 3. Chaos Engineering Testing
**Objective**: Test system resilience under failure conditions

```go
type ChaosTest struct {
    scenarios []ChaosScenario
    metrics   *ChaosMetrics
    recovery  *RecoveryValidator
}
```
