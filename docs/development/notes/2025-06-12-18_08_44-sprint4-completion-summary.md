### Middleware Integration Ready
The observability system integrates seamlessly with existing Lift middleware:

```go
func ObservabilityMiddleware(logger observability.StructuredLogger) middleware.Middleware {
    return func(next lift.Handler) lift.Handler {
        return lift.HandlerFunc(func(ctx *lift.Context) error {
            // Add observability context
            ctx.Logger = logger.
                WithRequestID(ctx.RequestID).
                WithTenantID(ctx.TenantID()).
                WithUserID(ctx.UserID())
            
            return next.Handle(ctx)
        })
    }
}
```
