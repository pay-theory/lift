# Lift Framework - Next Round Development Plan

**Date**: 2025-06-12-17_50_26  
**Project Manager**: AI Assistant  
**Purpose**: Plan for next development round focusing on critical security and infrastructure components

## Current Status Summary

Based on the progress review and infrastructure security assistant guidance, we have:

### âœ… Foundation Complete
- Core framework (App, Context, Handler, Router)
- Basic middleware suite (Logger, Recover, CORS, Timeout, Metrics, RequestID, ErrorHandler)
- Security structures (Config, Principal, Secrets Manager integration)
- Testing framework basics
- Two working examples (hello-world, basic-crud-api)

### ðŸš§ Critical Gaps Identified
1. **JWT Authentication Middleware** - Not implemented (CRITICAL)
2. **DynamORM Integration** - Stubbed but not functional
3. **Rate Limiting** - Solution identified (Limited library) but not implemented
4. **Request Signing** - Not implemented
5. **Event Source Adapters** - Only basic API Gateway stub
6. **CloudWatch Integration** - Not implemented
7. **Health Check Endpoints** - Not implemented

## Next Round Priorities (Sprint 3-4 Focus)

### Priority 1: JWT Authentication Middleware ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**Timeline**: Sprint 3 Week 1-2  
**Blocker**: This is required for any production use

**Key Features Required**:
- Token extraction from Authorization header
- Support for HS256 and RS256 algorithms
- Multi-tenant validation
- Role-based access control
- Token caching for performance
- Integration with existing Principal system

### Priority 2: Request Signing Middleware ðŸŸ¡ HIGH
**Timeline**: Sprint 3 Week 2  
**Purpose**: Secure API-to-API communication

### Priority 3: Health Check System ðŸŸ¡ HIGH
**Timeline**: Sprint 3 Week 2  
**Purpose**: Production monitoring readiness

### Priority 4: Rate Limiting Integration ðŸŸ  MEDIUM
**Timeline**: Sprint 4 Week 1  
**Dependency**: Requires DynamORM completion by Integration team

### Priority 5: CloudWatch Integration ðŸŸ  MEDIUM
**Timeline**: Sprint 4 Week 2  
**Purpose**: Production observability

## Implementation Plan

### Task 1: JWT Authentication Middleware
**Files to Create**:
- `pkg/middleware/auth.go` - Main JWT middleware
- `pkg/security/jwt.go` - JWT validation utilities
- `examples/jwt-auth/` - Complete JWT authentication example

**Success Criteria**:
- Authentication overhead < 2ms
- Multi-tenant isolation verified
- Role-based access working
- Comprehensive test coverage > 90%

### Task 2: Request Signing Middleware
**Files to Create**:
- `pkg/middleware/signing.go` - Request signature validation
- `pkg/security/signing.go` - Signature utilities
- `examples/signed-requests/` - Request signing example

### Task 3: Health Check System
**Files to Create**:
- `pkg/middleware/health.go` - Health check middleware
- `pkg/health/checker.go` - Health check framework
- `pkg/health/checks/` - Built-in health checks

### Task 4: CloudWatch Integration
**Files to Create**:
- `pkg/observability/cloudwatch/logger.go`
- `pkg/observability/cloudwatch/metrics.go`
- `pkg/observability/xray/tracer.go`

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- JWT authentication overhead: < 2ms
- Request signing overhead: < 1ms
- Health check response time: < 50ms
- CloudWatch integration overhead: < 3ms

### Security Targets
- Multi-tenant isolation: 100% verified
- Authentication bypass: 0 vulnerabilities
- Rate limiting effectiveness: > 99%
- Audit logging coverage: 100%

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. âœ… Create this development plan
2. ðŸ”„ Begin JWT authentication middleware implementation
3. ðŸ”„ Set up JWT testing framework
4. ðŸ”„ Create JWT authentication example

### Sprint 3 Goals
- Complete JWT authentication middleware
- Implement request signing middleware
- Create health check system
- Begin CloudWatch integration

### Sprint 4 Goals
- Complete CloudWatch integration
- Integrate Limited library (pending DynamORM)
- Create comprehensive security examples
- Performance optimization and benchmarking

This plan focuses on the most critical security and infrastructure components needed for production readiness while maintaining alignment with the overall Lift framework architecture and Pay Theory's security requirements.
