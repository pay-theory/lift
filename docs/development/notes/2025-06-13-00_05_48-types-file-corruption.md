# Types File Corruption Issue

**Date:** 2025-06-13-00_05_48  
**Issue:** pkg/testing/enterprise/types.go file corruption during edit

## Problem
During the process of fixing compilation errors, the types.go file became corrupted with duplicate type definitions and misplaced package declarations. This happened when trying to add the ValidationSummary type and fix the ContractValidationResult structure.

## Current State
The file contains duplicate definitions for:
- Severity types and constants
- TestStatus types and constants  
- Many other type definitions

## Resolution Needed
The types.go file needs to be cleaned up to remove all duplicate definitions. The file should contain only one set of each type definition.

## Impact
This is blocking compilation of the examples in the multi-service-demo directory.

## Next Steps
1. Clean up the types.go file by removing duplicates
2. Ensure ValidationSummary type is properly defined
3. Ensure ContractValidationResult has the correct Summary field
4. Test compilation after cleanup
