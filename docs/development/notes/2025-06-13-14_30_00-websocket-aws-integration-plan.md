# WebSocket AWS Integration Testing Plan
Date: 2025-06-13

## Overview
We have a single Lift user whose application is still in development. This provides an ideal opportunity to validate our WebSocket implementation in a real AWS environment without production pressure.

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Integration (Week 2)
Work directly with the user to:

1. **Deploy WebSocket Infrastructure**
   - Help them set up API Gateway WebSocket API
   - Configure Lambda functions with new Lift WebSocket handlers
   - Create DynamoDB table for connection management
   - Set up CloudWatch logging and monitoring

2. **Validate Core Functionality**
   - Test $connect/$disconnect lifecycle
   - Verify message routing
   - Confirm connection persistence in DynamoDB
   - Test SDK v2 management API calls

3. **Performance Baseline**
   - Measure real-world latency
   - Monitor Lambda cold starts
   - Track DynamoDB performance
   - Validate memory usage

### Phase 2: Feature Validation (Week 3)
Collaborate on their specific use cases:

1. **Connection Management**
   - Test automatic connection tracking
   - Validate TTL cleanup
   - Query connections by user/tenant
   - Handle connection failures gracefully

2. **Middleware Integration**
   - Implement their authentication needs
   - Add custom logging/metrics
   - Test error handling paths
   - Validate context propagation

3. **Scale Testing**
   - Simulate multiple concurrent connections
   - Test broadcast performance
   - Measure DynamoDB throughput
   - Identify bottlenecks

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (Week 4)
Prepare for their eventual production launch:

1. **Operational Excellence**
   - Set up CloudWatch dashboards
   - Configure alarms and alerts
   - Document runbooks
   - Plan for disaster recovery

2. **Security Hardening**
   - Review IAM permissions
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add request validation
   - Test authorization flows

3. **Migration Support**
   - Help migrate existing code to new patterns
   - Provide code review and optimization
   - Create custom examples for their use cases
   - Document lessons learned

## Collaboration Approach

### Direct Support
- **Pair Programming Sessions**: Work together on implementation
- **Code Reviews**: Review their WebSocket handlers
- **Architecture Discussions**: Optimize for their specific needs
- **Troubleshooting**: Debug issues together

### Feedback Loop
- **Daily Check-ins**: Quick sync on progress and blockers
- **Weekly Demos**: Show incremental improvements
- **Issue Tracking**: Document and fix problems quickly
- **Feature Requests**: Prioritize based on their needs

### Knowledge Transfer
- **Custom Documentation**: Create guides for their use cases
- **Example Code**: Build examples that match their patterns
- **Best Practices**: Share WebSocket and serverless expertise
- **Team Training**: Help their team understand Lift

## Benefits for Both Parties

### For the User
- **Expert Guidance**: Direct support from Lift team
- **Faster Development**: Accelerated WebSocket implementation
- **Production-Ready Code**: Battle-tested patterns
- **Cost Optimization**: Efficient AWS resource usage

### For Lift
- **Real-World Validation**: Prove WebSocket features work
- **User Feedback**: Improve based on actual needs
- **Use Case Examples**: Build relevant documentation
- **Success Story**: Create a reference implementation

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- ✅ Zero WebSocket errors in production
- ✅ < 100ms message latency (p99)
- ✅ 99.9% connection reliability
- ✅ Automatic scaling validated

### Business Metrics
- ✅ User successfully launches with WebSockets
- ✅ Development time reduced by 50%+
- ✅ Positive user testimonial
- ✅ Reference architecture created

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **AWS Limits**: Pre-identify and request increases
- **Cold Starts**: Implement warming strategies
- **DynamoDB Throttling**: Use on-demand pricing
- **Network Issues**: Add retry logic

### Process Risks
- **Communication Gaps**: Daily syncs prevent surprises
- **Scope Creep**: Focus on core WebSocket needs
- **Timeline Pressure**: Set realistic expectations
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Document everything

## Timeline

### Week 2 (June 17-21)
- Mon-Tue: Infrastructure setup
- Wed-Thu: Basic integration testing
- Fri: Performance baseline

### Week 3 (June 24-28)
- Mon-Tue: Feature implementation
- Wed-Thu: Scale testing
- Fri: Documentation

### Week 4 (July 1-5)
- Mon-Tue: Production hardening
- Wed-Thu: Migration support
- Fri: Final review and handoff

## Next Steps

1. **Reach out to the user** to schedule initial planning session
2. **Create shared Slack channel** for quick communication
3. **Set up shared AWS account** for testing
4. **Plan first pair programming session** for infrastructure setup

## Conclusion

Having a development user as our integration partner is ideal because:
- We can iterate quickly without production pressure
- They get expert help with their WebSocket implementation
- We validate our features with real use cases
- Both parties benefit from the collaboration

This partnership will ensure Lift's WebSocket support is truly production-ready and meets real-world needs.
