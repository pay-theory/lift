# Lift Project Review - AI Assistant Preparation

**Date**: 2025-06-12-15_32_34  
**Reviewer**: AI Project Manager  
**Purpose**: Prepare for creating AI assistant prompts for lift development implementation

## Project Overview

The Lift Framework is a type-safe, Lambda-native handler framework for Go designed to eliminate 80% of Lambda handler boilerplate while providing production-grade features including security, observability, and multi-tenant support.

## Key Project Documents Reviewed

1. **DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md** - 40-week comprehensive plan with 10 phases
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md** - 20 sprint breakdown with deliverables
3. **SPRINT_PLAN.md** - Team structure and sprint methodology
4. **TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Complete system design

## Current Project Status

- **Phase**: Foundation/Planning complete
- **Duration**: 40 weeks (20 sprints of 2 weeks each)
- **Team Size**: 3-5 developers expected
- **Target**: Production-ready Lambda framework with <15ms cold start overhead

## Key Technical Requirements

### Core Features
- Type-safe handlers using Go generics
- Automatic request parsing and validation
- Comprehensive middleware system
- Multi-trigger support (API Gateway, SQS, S3, EventBridge)
- DynamORM integration
- Production observability (logging, metrics, tracing)

### Performance Targets
- Cold start overhead: <15ms
- Memory overhead: <5MB
- Throughput: 50,000+ req/sec
- Test coverage: 80%+

### Security Requirements
- JWT authentication
- Multi-tenant security
- Cross-account communication
- AWS Secrets Manager integration
- Request signing and validation

## Implementation Strategy

The project is divided into manageable phases:

1. **Foundation** (Sprints 1-4) - Core types, routing, security foundation
2. **Security & Middleware** (Sprints 5-8) - Auth, middleware system, event sources
3. **Data & Integration** (Sprints 9-12) - DynamORM, observability
4. **Testing & Performance** (Sprints 13-16) - Test framework, optimization
5. **Production & Launch** (Sprints 17-20) - Pulumi, Pay Theory integration, security audit

## AI Assistant Requirements

Based on the project scope and complexity, three specialized AI assistants are needed:

### 1. Core Framework Developer
**Focus**: Core types, handlers, routing, middleware architecture
**Skills**: Go generics, Lambda runtime, type safety, performance optimization

### 2. Infrastructure & Security Developer
**Focus**: Security, observability, database integration, Pulumi components
**Skills**: AWS services, security patterns, monitoring, infrastructure as code

### 3. Integration & Testing Developer
**Focus**: DynamORM integration, testing framework, examples, documentation
**Skills**: Testing patterns, API design, documentation, integration patterns

## Key Success Criteria

- 80% code reduction from raw Lambda handlers
- Sub-15ms cold start performance
- Comprehensive security features
- Production-ready observability
- Complete testing framework
- Pay Theory platform integration

## Next Steps

Create three specialized AI assistant prompts that will:
1. Clearly define roles and responsibilities
2. Provide necessary context from planning documents
3. Establish quality standards and testing requirements
4. Enable parallel development while maintaining consistency
