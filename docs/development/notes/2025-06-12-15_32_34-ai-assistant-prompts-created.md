# AI Assistant Prompts Created for Lift Development

**Date**: 2025-06-12-15_32_34  
**Project Manager**: AI Assistant  
**Task**: Create AI assistant prompts for lift implementation

## Completed Deliverables

Successfully created three specialized AI assistant prompts to enable parallel development of the Lift framework:

### 1. Core Framework Developer Assistant
**File**: `lift-core-framework-assistant.md`
**Focus**: Type-safe handler system, routing engine, middleware architecture
**Responsibilities**:
- Type-safe handlers using Go generics
- Enhanced context system with utilities
- Lambda-optimized routing system
- Request/response handling
- Application container orchestration

**Key Performance Targets**:
- <15ms cold start overhead
- <5MB memory overhead
- 50,000+ req/sec throughput
- 85%+ test coverage

### 2. Infrastructure & Security Developer Assistant
**File**: `lift-infrastructure-security-assistant.md`
**Focus**: Security layer, observability systems, AWS integrations
**Responsibilities**:
- Multi-tenant security with enterprise features
- Authentication & authorization middleware
- Production monitoring and alerting
- Database integration with connection pooling
- Event source adapters for multiple triggers
- Infrastructure as Code with Pulumi

**Key Security Features**:
- JWT authentication with RBAC
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Cross-account communication
- Request signing and validation
- AWS Secrets Manager integration

### 3. Integration & Testing Developer Assistant
**File**: `lift-integration-testing-assistant.md`
**Focus**: Testing framework, DynamORM integration, examples
**Responsibilities**:
- Comprehensive testing framework
- DynamORM deep integration with transactions
- Real-world example applications
- Mock systems for dependencies
- Performance testing and benchmarking
- Documentation and examples generation

**Key Integration Features**:
- Automatic transaction management
- Single table and multi-table patterns
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Load testing with realistic patterns
- Comprehensive example suite

## Technical Alignment

All prompts are aligned with:
- **DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md** - 40-week comprehensive strategy
- **IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md** - 20 sprint breakdown
- **TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md** - System design specifications
- **SPRINT_PLAN.md** - Team structure and methodology

## Quality Standards Enforced

Each assistant prompt includes:
- **Testing Requirements**: 80%+ code coverage enforced
- **Performance Metrics**: Specific targets for cold start, memory, throughput
- **Security Standards**: Multi-tenant isolation, enterprise security patterns
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive examples and API documentation
- **Integration Points**: Clear interfaces between teams

## Development Workflow Integration

All prompts support:
- **Sprint Process**: 2-week sprints with mid-sprint reviews
- **Code Quality**: Continuous integration with coverage enforcement
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous benchmarking with each change
- **Security Reviews**: Regular security assessments and audits

## Success Criteria

The prompts enable:
- **Parallel Development**: Three teams can work simultaneously
- **Consistency**: Shared interfaces and quality standards
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing and performance requirements
- **Pay Theory Integration**: Specific patterns for multi-tenant and cross-account features

## Next Steps

1. Assign AI assistants to each role
2. Begin implementation following sprint schedule
3. Coordinate regular integration points between teams
4. Monitor progress against roadmap deliverables

The AI assistant prompts provide comprehensive guidance for implementing the Lift framework according to Pay Theory's requirements while maintaining high standards for security, performance, and developer experience.
