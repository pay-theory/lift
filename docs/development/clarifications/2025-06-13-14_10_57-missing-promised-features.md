# Missing Promised Features in Lift - Critical Clarification
**Date**: 2025-06-13
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: Customer deliverables at risk

## Summary
Multiple critical features were reported as complete but do not exist in the codebase. This is causing significant issues with customer deliverables and team credibility.

## Features Reported as Done But Missing

### 1. JWT Authentication Context Methods ❌
**Promised**:
```go
ctx.Claims()     // Get JWT claims
ctx.UserID()     // Get user ID from JWT
ctx.TenantID()   // Get tenant ID from JWT
ctx.GetUserID()  // Alternative method for user ID
```
**Reality**: None of these methods exist in lift.Context

### 2. Advanced JWT Middleware ❌
**Promised**:
```go
lift.WithJWTAuth()  // Built-in JWT authentication middleware
```
**Reality**: No built-in JWT middleware exists

### 3. Security Context ❌
**Promised**:
```go
lift.WithSecurity()       // Security middleware
secCtx.GetPrincipal()     // Get security principal
```
**Reality**: No security middleware or security context exists

## Impact Analysis

### Test Failures
- `basic-crud-api` tests failing due to missing tenant/user context
- Factory pattern tests expecting JWT context that doesn't exist
- Authentication tests failing due to missing middleware

### Customer Impact
- Cannot implement multi-tenant isolation without tenant context
- Cannot implement user-specific operations without user context
- Cannot enforce security policies without security middleware
- Manual JWT validation required everywhere

## Required Immediate Actions

1. **Implement Core JWT Context Methods**
   - Add Claims(), UserID(), TenantID() to lift.Context
   - Ensure backward compatibility

2. **Create JWT Middleware**
   - Implement lift.WithJWTAuth() middleware
   - Support standard JWT validation
   - Populate context with claims

3. **Create Security Middleware**
   - Implement lift.WithSecurity()
   - Create SecurityContext interface
   - Support principal extraction

4. **Fix Failing Tests**
   - Update tests to use actual implemented features
   - Remove references to non-existent features

## Questions for Team

1. Why were these features marked as complete?
2. What other features might be missing?
3. What is the actual vs promised feature set?
4. How do we prevent this in the future?

## Recommended Process Changes

1. **Code Review Requirements**
   - Mandatory demo of working features
   - Test coverage requirements
   - Documentation requirements

2. **Definition of Done**
   - Feature must be implemented
   - Tests must pass
   - Documentation must exist
   - Demo must be provided

3. **Sprint Planning**
   - Realistic estimates based on actual implementation
   - No marking features as done until verified
