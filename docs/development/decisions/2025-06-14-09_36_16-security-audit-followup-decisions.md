# Security Audit Follow-up Decisions - Second Pass

**Date:** June 14, 2025  
**Time:** 09:36:16  
**Context:** Post-remediation security audit revealed additional critical issues  
**Decision Maker:** Senior Go Engineer  
**Status:** URGENT - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED  

## Decision Summary

The second-pass security audit using static analysis tools has revealed **3 critical Go standard library vulnerabilities** and **328 total issues** requiring immediate attention. While significant security improvements have been made, new critical findings mandate urgent action.

## ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY ACTIONS - NEXT 24 HOURS

### 1. Go Version Upgrade - MANDATORY IMMEDIATE
**Issue:** 3 active CVEs in Go 1.23.9  
**Decision:** HALT ALL DEPLOYMENTS until Go upgrade complete  
**Timeline:** Complete within 24 hours  
**Assignee:** DevOps + Core framework team  

**Required Actions:**
- Update go.mod to require Go 1.23.10
- Update CI/CD pipeline Go version
- Test all builds with new version
- Deploy updated toolchain to all environments

**Vulnerabilities Fixed:**
- GO-2025-3751: HTTP header information disclosure
- GO-2025-3750: File system security (Windows)
- GO-2025-3749: X.509 certificate validation bypass

### 2. MD5 Cryptographic Weakness - URGENT
**Issue:** Weak MD5 hash in caching system  
**Location:** `pkg/features/caching.go:5`  
**Decision:** Replace with SHA-256 immediately  
**Timeline:** Complete within 24 hours  
**Assignee:** Security team lead

**Implementation:**
```go
// Replace this:
import "crypto/md5"

// With this:
import "crypto/sha256"
```

### 3. Critical Error Handling - URGENT  
**Issue:** 125 unchecked error returns in security-critical code  
**Decision:** Fix all security-critical paths immediately  
**Timeline:** Complete within 48 hours  
**Assignee:** Distributed across teams by package

**Priority Order:**
1. `pkg/security/*` - All error returns
2. `pkg/observability/xray/*` - Tracing operations  
3. `pkg/middleware/*` - Authentication/authorization
4. `pkg/lift/*` - Core framework operations

## ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY FIXES - NEXT 72 HOURS

### 4. Mutex Lock Copying Fixes
**Issue:** 45 instances of lock copying causing race conditions  
**Decision:** Fix all mutex-related race conditions  
**Timeline:** Complete within 72 hours  

**Critical Locations:**
- `pkg/dev/server.go:267` - Stats copying
- `pkg/testing/deployment/validator.go` - Environment passing
- `pkg/observability/cloudwatch/logger.go` - Logger copying

**Pattern Fix:**
```go
// Replace value passing:
func ProcessEnvironment(env Environment)

// With pointer passing:  
func ProcessEnvironment(env *Environment)
```

### 5. File Permission Hardening
**Issue:** CLI commands creating files with overly permissive permissions  
**Decision:** Implement secure file permissions  
**Timeline:** Complete within 48 hours

**Required Changes:**
```go
// Current (insecure):
os.MkdirAll(name, 0755)           // â†’ 0750
os.WriteFile(path, data, 0644)    // â†’ 0600
```

### 6. HTTP Server Timeout Configuration
**Issue:** Slowloris attack vulnerability in HTTP servers  
**Decision:** Add timeout configurations to all HTTP servers  
**Timeline:** Complete within 72 hours

**Required Implementation:**
```go
s.server = &http.Server{
    Addr:               fmt.Sprintf(":%d", s.config.Port),
    Handler:            handler,
    ReadHeaderTimeout:  10 * time.Second,  // Add
    ReadTimeout:        30 * time.Second,  // Add
    WriteTimeout:       30 * time.Second,  // Add
    IdleTimeout:        60 * time.Second,  // Add
}
```

## ðŸŸ  MEDIUM PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS - NEXT 2 WEEKS

### 7. Deprecated API Updates
**Decision:** Update all deprecated API usage  
**Timeline:** Complete within 1 week

**Required Updates:**
- Replace `io/ioutil` with `io` and `os`
- Replace `strings.Title` with `golang.org/x/text/cases`
- Replace `netErr.Temporary()` with proper timeout handling

### 8. Context Key Type Safety
**Decision:** Implement custom context key types  
**Timeline:** Complete within 1 week

**Implementation:**
```go
// Define custom types:
type contextKey string

const (
    lambdaRequestIDKey contextKey = "lambda_request_id"
    lambdaFunctionKey  contextKey = "lambda_function_name"
)

// Use instead of string keys
ctx = context.WithValue(ctx, lambdaRequestIDKey, lc.AwsRequestID)
```
