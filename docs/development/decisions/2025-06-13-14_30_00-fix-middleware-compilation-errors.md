# Decision: Fix Middleware Compilation Errors
Date: 2025-06-13-14_30_00

## Status
Implemented

## Context
All middleware packages were experiencing compilation errors due to:
1. Missing JWT authentication methods in `lift.Context`
2. Interface embedding issues with observability interfaces

## Decision
We chose to implement two fixes:

1. **Add Authentication Methods to Context**: Added the following methods to `lift.Context`:
   - `SetClaims(claims map[string]interface{})`
   - `Claims() map[string]interface{}`
   - `GetClaim(key string) interface{}`
   - `IsAuthenticated() bool`

2. **Explicit Method Declaration in Observability Interfaces**: Instead of relying on interface embedding, we explicitly declared all methods in the observability interfaces to avoid type resolution issues.

## Rationale

### Why Explicit Methods Over Interface Embedding
While Go supports interface embedding, the compiler was having issues resolving the inherited methods when the observability package imported the lift package. This created a circular dependency issue. By explicitly declaring the methods, we:
- Avoided the circular dependency resolution issues
- Made the interface contracts more explicit and clear
- Maintained compatibility with existing implementations

### Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **Type Aliases**: Would have been simpler but less flexible for future extensions
2. **Package Restructuring**: Would have required significant refactoring
3. **Import Cycle Resolution**: Would have been complex and might not have fully resolved the issue

## Consequences

### Positive
- All middleware packages now compile successfully
- Tests pass without modification to business logic
- Clear interface contracts
- No performance impact

### Negative
- Slight duplication of method signatures between interfaces
- Must manually keep methods in sync if lift interfaces change
- Less DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach

### Maintenance Considerations
- When updating `lift.Logger` or `lift.MetricsCollector` interfaces, must also update the corresponding observability interfaces
- Mock implementations in tests must implement all methods

## Implementation Details
1. Updated `pkg/lift/context.go` to add authentication methods
2. Updated `pkg/observability/interfaces.go` to explicitly declare all methods
3. Updated test mocks to implement new methods:
   - `RecordLatency`
   - `RecordError`
   - `RecordSuccess`

## Validation
- All packages build successfully: `go build ./...`
- All middleware tests pass: `go test ./pkg/middleware/...`
- No runtime behavior changes
