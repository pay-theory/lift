**Sprint**: 4  
**Decision Type**: Technical Architecture  
**Status**: ✅ APPROVED & IMPLEMENTED

## 🎯 Decision Summary

We have implemented a comprehensive performance benchmarking architecture for the Lift framework to establish baseline performance metrics and guide optimization efforts in Sprint 4.

## 📋 Context

### Problem Statement

- Lack of systematic performance measurement infrastructure
- Need for data-driven optimization approach

### Performance Targets
- **Cold Start**: <15ms framework overhead
- **Memory Usage**: <5MB overhead  
- **Throughput**: >50,000 requests/second
- **Middleware Overhead**: <0.1ms per middleware
- **Event Parsing**: <1ms per event
